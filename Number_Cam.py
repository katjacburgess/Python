#Vars

varOne = (-3)
 
varTwo = (3)



if (varOne + varTwo) == 0:
#                    ^^ that's an equality, it checks if the things on one side are equal to the other side. if it's true the statements after 
	#'yes' case
	print "words %d" % varOne
	print "words " + str(varOne)
	print "varOne and varTwo sum to Zero!"
else:
	#'not' case
